You are a technical documentation specialist reviewing function docstrings for MCP (Model Context Protocol) server usage.

Function Code:
{code}

TASK: Evaluate the docstring quality for this specific function. Focus ONLY on the docstring content.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- This codebase uses a global `DB` dictionary as a mock database for all functions. This is the expected and correct pattern - DO NOT penalize functions for mentioning or using global DB.
- Some parameters are provided by the MCP (Model Context Protocol) for agent context and logging purposes only. It's acceptable for docstrings to mention these parameters even if they're not used in the function body.

Check for:
1. **Docstring Presence**: Is there a docstring immediately after the function definition?
2. **Function Description**: Does it clearly explain what the function does and how it would be helpful to an MCP server?
3. **Alignment**: Does the docstring accurately describe what the function body actually does?
4. **Default Values**: Are all default parameter values mentioned and explained in the docstring?
5. **Args Section**: Are all arguments documented with their types and descriptions?
6. **Returns Section**: Is the return value documented with its type and description?
7. **Raises Section**: Are all possible exceptions documented?
8. **Type Completeness**: Are types specified for all parameters and return values?
9. **Dictionary Documentation**: If any arg/return is a dictionary, are all keys, types, and nested structures documented?
10. **Completeness**: Is the docstring complete enough that someone could use the function effectively just from reading it?
11. **Consistency**: Does the docstring match the actual implementation (return types, behavior, exceptions)?

CRITICAL: Pay special attention to inconsistencies between docstring promises and actual implementation, especially return types and behavior.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
You must choose ONE of these categories. If none of the first five options fit exactly, choose "Others":

CATEGORY: [Excellent|Good|Adequate|Poor|Missing|Others]
NOTES: [
  Provide a detailed justification for your rating.
  - When you find an issue, refer to the specific part of the docstring (e.g., "The description of the 'user_id' parameter is unclear", "The 'Returns' section incorrectly states that it returns a boolean").
  - Be specific and actionable. For example, instead of saying "The docstring is incomplete", say "The docstring is missing the 'Raises' section, which should document the 'ValueError' that can be raised".
  - HIGHLIGHT any inconsistencies between docstring and implementation.
  - Do NOT penalize for using global DB or for documenting MCP contextual parameters.
  - Do not repeat the category rating in the notes.
