You are a software engineer responsible for ensuring API consistency. Your task is to compare a function's docstring against its Function Calling (FC) Schema.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:**
1.  The FCSpec Schema **ONLY** defines the function's **INPUTS**. It is not expected to contain any information about the function's return value or the errors it might raise.
2.  The function name in the Python code and the `name` field in the schema are **EXPECTED TO BE DIFFERENT**.

**TASK:**
Based on the critical context above, compare ONLY the **input parameters** documented in the function's docstring against the parameters defined in the schema. Ignore any information in the docstring related to `Returns` or `Raises`.

FUNCTION CODE:
```python
{code}
```

FUNCTION SCHEMA:
```json
{schema}
```

**ANALYSIS CRITERIA (INPUT PARAMETERS ONLY):**
Carefully check for the following types of inconsistencies for input parameters:

1.  **Parameter Mismatch**:
    *   Are there any parameters in the docstring's `Args` section that are missing from the schema?
    *   Are there any parameters in the schema that are missing from the docstring's `Args` section?
    *   Are the names of the parameters identical?

2.  **Type Mismatch**:
    *   Do the data types of all parameters in the docstring match their corresponding types in the schema? (e.g., `str` vs. `string`, `int` vs. `integer`).

3.  **Description Mismatch**:
    *   Does the description of each parameter in the docstring accurately reflect its description in the schema?

4.  **Required Mismatch**:
    *   Are the required parameters in the schema also documented as required (e.g., not optional) in the docstring?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
You must choose ONE of these categories.

CATEGORY: [Aligned|Mismatched]
NOTES: [
  - If the input parameters in the docstring and schema are perfectly aligned, briefly state that.
  - If there are any mismatches related ONLY to the input parameters, provide a detailed, point-by-point list of every discrepancy.
  - Do NOT report mismatches related to function names, return values, or errors/exceptions.
