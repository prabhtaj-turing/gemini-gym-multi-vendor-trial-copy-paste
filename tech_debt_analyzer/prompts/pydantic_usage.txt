You are a Python expert reviewing Pydantic model usage for input validation in a single function.

Function Code:
{code}

TASK: Evaluate Pydantic model usage for INPUT VALIDATION ONLY in this specific function.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- This codebase uses a global `DB` dictionary as a mock database for all functions. This is the expected and correct pattern - DO NOT penalize functions for using global DB instead of real database connections.
- Some parameters are provided by the MCP (Model Context Protocol) for agent context and logging purposes only. These do not require validation as they are not functional parameters.

Check for:
1. **Pydantic Models for Input**: Are Pydantic models used to validate functional input parameters?
2. **Alternative Input Validation**: If Pydantic is not used, is there other input validation for functional parameters (type checking, manual validation, etc.)?
3. **Input Validation Coverage**: Are all functional input parameters properly validated through some method? (Note: MCP contextual parameters do not require validation)

ANALYSIS RULES:
- If Pydantic models are used for input validation = "Properly Used"
- If Pydantic is not used BUT other input validation methods are present = "Not Needed"
- If Pydantic is not used AND no input validation is done = "Missing Validation"
- If only some inputs are validated = "Partially Used"
- If function has no inputs that need validation = "Not Applicable"

Do NOT check output/return values - focus only on input parameter validation.
Do NOT penalize for using global DB dictionary - this is expected in this codebase.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
You must choose ONE of these categories. If none of the first five options fit exactly, choose "Others":

CATEGORY: [Properly Used|Partially Used|Not Needed|Missing Validation|Not Applicable|Others]
NOTES: [Only provide the justification for your rating. Explain what input validation (if any) is present for functional parameters and whether Pydantic would improve it. Do NOT penalize for using global DB or for lack of validation on MCP contextual parameters. Do not repeat the category rating in the notes.]
