        "status": "Incomplete",
        "notes": "The project structure is severely lacking.  The `SimulationEngine` folder is entirely missing, indicating a fundamental flaw in the organization.  The `APIs/generic_tools/` folder lacks the crucial `__init__.py` file, which is essential for defining the API's public interface. While a `tests` folder exists, it only contains `__init__.py`, and no actual test files are present.  This means there's no simulation logic, no API definition, and no tests.  The project is far from meeting the minimum requirements for a functional and well-structured API service."
