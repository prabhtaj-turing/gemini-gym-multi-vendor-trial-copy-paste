            "status": "Adequate",
            "notes": "The docstring is present and provides a reasonable overview of the function's purpose and parameters.  It correctly mentions the default value for `result_type`. The Args section accurately describes the parameters and their types. The Raises section is comprehensive, listing all potential exceptions.  The type hinting for the return value is present."

          "pydantic_usage": {
            "status": "Not Needed",
            "notes": "The function uses manual input validation for the `query` and `result_type` parameters.  It checks for the presence of `query`, its type and emptiness. It also checks the type and allowed values of `result_type`.  While Pydantic could be used to achieve the same validation more concisely, the existing manual validation is sufficient and covers all functional input parameters.  Therefore, Pydantic is not strictly needed for this function."

All functional input parameters (`query` and `result_type`) are used.  All documented exceptions are handled. There are no placeholders or TODO comments. The logic is complete and functional, relying on the `utils` module for external interactions (which are assumed to be correctly implemented). The docstring accurately reflects the function's behavior, including the return types for different `result_type` values and the exceptions raised."

            "notes": "The provided function `search` does not handle any phone number or email address inputs.  Its input is a search query string for YouTube, and it doesn't process or validate any data resembling phone numbers or email addresses. Therefore, the criteria of phone number normalization and email validation are not applicable."

All three main folders (SimulationEngine, tests, and the root API folder) are present and contain the core required files.  The `__init__.py` files are present in all necessary locations. The `SimulationEngine` folder contains all the expected core files (`db.py`, `models.py`, `custom_errors.py`, `utils.py`). The `tests` folder has a good structure with multiple test files. The main API folder contains the expected `__init__.py` (although the contents, specifically `_function_map`, are not visible and need to be checked)."
