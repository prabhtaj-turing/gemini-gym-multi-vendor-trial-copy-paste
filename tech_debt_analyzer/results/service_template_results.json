            "status": "Excellent",
            "notes": "The docstring is comprehensive and well-written.  It clearly explains the function's purpose, accurately reflects the function's behavior, and thoroughly documents all parameters, return values, and exceptions.  The descriptions are detailed and helpful, including explanations of default values and the structure of complex dictionary parameters and return values.  The nested structure of the `data` dictionary within the return value is meticulously documented, enhancing understandability.  The `Raises` section correctly lists potential exceptions and their causes.  There are no inconsistencies between the docstring and the implementation. The docstring is complete enough for someone to effectively use the function without needing to examine the code."

            "status": "Properly Used",
            "notes": "The function uses a Pydantic model (`ComplexInput`) to validate the `complex_param` input.  The `entity_name` parameter also has explicit validation checks for type and length.  All functional input parameters (`entity_name`, `complex_param`, `is_dry_run`) are validated.  The use of Pydantic for `complex_param` is efficient and handles complex data structure validation well.  The manual check for `entity_name` is also appropriate given its simple structure.  No improvements are needed regarding input validation."

            "notes": "All function parameters (`entity_name`, `complex_param`, `is_dry_run`) are properly type-annotated with their expected types.  The return type is also clearly specified as `Dict[str, Union[bool, str, dict]]`. The function does not use `**kwargs`.  Complex types like `Dict` and `Union` are correctly used in the type annotations."

            "notes": "The function is mostly complete and functional.  It correctly validates inputs, handles the dry-run scenario, and delegates the core logic to a utility function (`utils.perform_action`). The response formatting also aligns with the docstring. However, the `utils.perform_action` function is not provided, making it impossible to fully assess the completeness of the business logic.  The error handling for `ValidationError` is also implemented correctly.  The function uses all functional input parameters (`entity_name`, `complex_param`, `is_dry_run`) as expected.  The docstring accurately reflects the function's behavior and return type.  The only incompleteness stems from the reliance on an external, undefined function (`utils.perform_action`) for the core business logic.  Without knowing the implementation of `utils.perform_action`, a definitive \"Fully Implemented\" rating cannot be given."

            "status": "Not Applicable",
            "notes": "The provided code does not handle phone numbers or email addresses as inputs.  Therefore, the criteria of normalizing phone numbers and validating email addresses are not applicable. The function focuses on validating other input parameters (`entity_name` and `complex_param`), but these parameters do not include phone numbers or email addresses.  To receive a different rating, the function would need to be modified to accept and process such data."

All three main folders (SimulationEngine, tests, and the root API folder) are present and contain the core required files.  The `SimulationEngine` folder has all the essential components (`db.py`, `models.py`, `custom_errors.py`, `error_config.json`, etc.). The `tests` folder also meets the requirements."
