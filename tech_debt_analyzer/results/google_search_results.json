            "status": "Good",
            "notes": "The docstring is present and provides a reasonable overview of the function's purpose.  The description is clear enough, although it could be slightly more specific about its role within an MCP server context (e.g., how the results might be used to inform the server's response to a user request)."

            "status": "Not Needed",
            "notes": "The function uses manual input validation to check if `queries` is a non-empty list of non-empty strings.  While Pydantic could be used, the existing validation is sufficient and clear.  Using Pydantic would add complexity without significant benefit in this simple case."

            "status": "Excellent",
            "notes": "The function `get` has excellent parameter design and type annotations.  The `queries` parameter is correctly type-annotated as `List[str]`. The return type is clearly specified as `List[Dict[str, Any]]`.  There is no use of `**kwargs`. All type annotations are complete and accurately reflect the expected types."

            "notes": "The function correctly implements a Google search (simulated via `utils.get_gemini_response`).  All functional input parameters (`queries`) are used.  The documented exceptions (`ValidationError`) are properly implemented and handled. There are no TODOs, pass statements, or placeholders. The logic is complete and functional, given the use of the `utils.get_gemini_response` function. The docstring accurately reflects the function's behavior and return type."

            "status": "Not Applicable",
            "notes": "The provided function `get` does not handle phone numbers or email addresses as input.  Its input is a list of strings representing search queries.  Therefore, the criteria of phone number normalization and email validation are not applicable.  The function correctly validates that the input is a non-empty list of strings, but this is unrelated to the specified phone number and email address handling requirements."

      "project_structure": {
        "status": "Mostly Complete",
        "notes": "The project structure is largely compliant with modern standards.  All three main folders (SimulationEngine, tests, and the root API folder) are present and contain the core required files.  The `__init__.py` files are present in all necessary locations. The `SimulationEngine` folder contains all the expected core files (`db.py`, `models.py`, `custom_errors.py`, `error_config.json`). The `tests` folder has the expected structure.  The main API folder has a `README.md` which is good practice, but only one API file (`search.py`). While this is functional, a more robust API might have multiple files for better organization.  The files `m01.json` and `file_utils.py` in the `SimulationEngine` folder are not explicitly mentioned in the requirements but are not problematic.  The presence of `file_utils.py` suggests that a `common_utils` package might be a better location for such helper functions in a larger project."
