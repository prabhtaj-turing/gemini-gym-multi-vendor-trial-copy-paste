# Instructions

Go through all files in `APIs/retail` and mutations in `APIs/retail/mutations/m01`.

you need to implement retail/mutations/m02 and write tests for it.

Where we need to merge as many tools as possible into a single tool like all the order update related tools into a single tool.

We need to define the Args and Return for the mutation function in docstrings in details

You need to just write proxy to the original tools in `APIs/retail` and call them in the mutation function just like we did in `APIs/retail/mutations/m01`.

At the end write APIs/retail/mutations/m02/__init__.py file with all the tools in it similar to `APIs/retail/mutations/m01/__init__.py`.
