I have @libcst.log.py
Which have code that modify function names and args.

I want to write config for m03 in APIs/retail/SimulationEngine/mutation_engine/static_changes_configs

that config will have mutation name which is m03, and each functions from original tools which are at the toop level APIs/retail

for each tool function, i want to have new function name and new args name in that config for all the functions mentioned in _function_map in APIs/retail/__init__.py

then I want a script in APIs/retail/SimulationEngine/mutation_engine/builder that will take that config json path and 
generate mutation in APIs/retail/mutations/{name} folder, it will copy the original files and test files and modify the function names and args names in the code.

use "python" command to run the script.
