We created APIs/retail/mutations/m01 and APIs/retail/mutations/m02 mutations from APIs/retail tools by renaming or restructure the interfaces of the original tools.

Now in m01 and m02, we need to carefully use a try-except block, where we will replace the field names. We will have a map of replacements for each API in the except block to update the error message according to the updated fields, and we will raise the exact same error type with updated error messages based on the updated or replaced field names.

Now I want keep the detailed docstrings, 

but I want add concise error messages for the except block, replace the field names ro keywords with the updated field names or interface.
