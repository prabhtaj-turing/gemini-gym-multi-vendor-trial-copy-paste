# Instructions

Go through all files in `APIs/retail`.

For each tool (see `_function_map` in `retail/__init__.py`), create a mutation version in `APIs/retail/SimulationEngine/mutation_engine/mutations/m01`, keeping the same file structure.

Change the function name, argument names, and return structure to make it a mutation. The mutation function should call the original function as a proxy.

Do not put all arguments into a single input argument. You can group some arguments or return values, but keep it realistic.

Rename arguments and return fields logically.

Write a concise docstring for the mutated function. The docstring should include a Raises section and mention the file name.

Make the mutation look like a natural variant of the original tool.

Do not use any Pydantic models or original filename in the mutation files. All input and output should be handled as raw JSON-compatible Python types (dict, list, str, int, etc).

After implementing the mutation, write the test for the mutation in `APIs/retail/mutations/m01/tests` with the same file structure as the original tool files, where we will have test class, testing the mutation function by passing args to mutated function and capturing the inputs for the original function assert it with the expected inputs to the original function, you can look into the original tool tests for reference.
